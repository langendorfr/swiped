To run call the R script *swiped.R* with the name of a text file as an input argument.

```console
Rscript swiped.R rel.txt
```

You can also include the second input argument "named" to have the English version of each word appear above its corresponding swiped representation.

```console
Rscript swiped.R rel.txt named
```
